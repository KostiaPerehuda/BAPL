Activity 2 - Rules For Identifiers

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Add underscores to the list of valid characters in identifiers.

This is done as a commit to the project-homework interpreter.

b) Consider what other characters could be useful in that set.

I can't think of any immediately useful characters.
Maybe adding alphabetic characters from other dialects might be useful,
for example letters from German or Cyrillic alphabets,
but I'm not sure that this will be of significant benefit for the users.
It is important to note that we should not try to add any special characters
like dashes to this set, as they will be confused with operators by the parser.

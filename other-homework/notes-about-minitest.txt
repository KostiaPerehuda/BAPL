Notes about minitest

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pulled the minitest from the solutions repository and run the interpreter against it. Will be used as th basis for
regression testing during further work.

Modifications to the Interpreter:

1. Allowed for numbers written in E-notation to have an optional plus sign next to the exponent.

Modifications to the minitest:

1. Adapted 'function id (x)' to define a local variable named 'z' instead of local variable named 'x' because the
Interpreter explicitly forbids redefinition of formal parameters.

2. Changed 'function test5 (x, y, z = x * y)' to 'function test5 (x, y, z = 10 * 20)' because the interpreter
doesn't allow usage of other function parameters in the default expression for the final parameter.

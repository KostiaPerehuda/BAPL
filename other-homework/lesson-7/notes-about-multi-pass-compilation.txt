Introduce multi-pass compilation for functions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compilation is now split in three stages:
    1. Every function is declared
    2. Every function is compiled
    3. Verify every declared function is also defined

This preserves the opportunity to check at compile time if the function is declared,
but eliminates the need for forward declarations.
Forward declarations are still present as a feature, to comply with the exercises specification.
Forward declarations, however, introduce a possiblity for a function being declared but never defined,
therefore introducing the possibility of calling a function that has no asscoiated code.

I've added a check to verify at compile time that every declared function is also defined. Moreover,
runtime can now signal if a call-site has no associated code.

Activity 11a - Adding More Operators

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Add a unary minus operator (negation) to the language.

This is done as a commit to the project-homework interpreter.

Notes:
With current implmentation the operator has priority higher than
multiplicative binary operators but lower that the exponent operator.
